* Analysis is in the "Dan's Analysis in R.RMD" File
* See this same RMD analysis on [**Rpubs**](https://rpubs.com/DanielCusick/1174150)
* When attempting even a manual upload of cps_00001.dat (from my RMD analysis), GitHub said "Yowza, thatâ€™s a big file. Try again with a file smaller than 25MB." Therefore I shared the cps_00001.dat and cps_00001.xml files on Google Drive.
* cps_00001.dat and cps_00001.xml are cleaner and more usable than census2324ind.csv, as census2324ind.csv was merged together from multiple monthly files.
