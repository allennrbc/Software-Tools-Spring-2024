For this analysis, I read in a subset of U.S. Census Current Population
Survey data, which includes year, month, industry and employment status
information. The data was extracted from
[**IPUMS.org**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/). My goal is to gain insight
on involuntary part-time work, particularly to tease out whether or not
involuntary part-time work stands out in the retail industry.

### Selected variables from [**IPUMS Census Data Definitions**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/group?id=core_work)

-   WHYPTLWK Reason for working part time last week
-   WKSTAT Full or part-time status
-   IND1950 Industry codes, which are [**comparable over
    time**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/IND1950#comparability_section)
-   WTFINL sample weight for survey respondent

The WHYPTLWK census variable provides detailed reasons for part-time
work. Here we have focused on **60 Could only find part-time work**.
This is a subgroup of a classification often referred to as “Part-Time
for Economic Reasons.”

``` r

#### Data Prep: Consolidate Industries and date data

Group industries based on [**IND1950

#### Survey Sample Weighting

-   “For person-level analyses of non-supplement IPUMS-CPS data, apply
    the WTFINL variable. [**WTFINL gives the population represented by
    each individual in the
    sample.**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/faq)”
-   A WTFINL value of 2469 means the survey respondent is representative
    of 2469 Americans.
-   The CPS survey is monthly. Therefore, each month should reflect a
    sample of the entire U.S. Population.

``` r
# Look at WTFINL Weight
feb24<-data3 %>% filter(YEAR==2024, MONTH==2)
sum(feb24$WTFINL)
```

    ## [1] 331331604

``` r
# 331,331,604 very close to U.S. Population
# For a given month, the weight values add up to the U.S. Population
```

To factor in the sample weights, we created 1-or-0 variables for “Could
only find part-time work” (OFPTW) and “Part-Time Work” (PTW). This
allows individuals who fit these categories to be easily multipled by
their WTFINL weighted value.

``` r
data4<-data3 %>% mutate(OFPTW = ifelse(WHYPTLWK==60,1,0),
                 PTW = ifelse(WKSTAT==12|WKSTAT==20|WKSTAT==21|WKSTAT==22|WKSTAT==40|WKSTAT==41,1,0))

data5<-data4[,c(1:3,8,11:17)] %>% filter(PTW==1)
data6<-data5 %>% mutate(W_OFPTW = WTFINL*OFPTW, W_PTW = WTFINL*PTW)
data6[,c(6:13)] %>% filter(Industry=="Retail Trade")
```

#### How many people are we talking about?

``` r

Retail tops the list of total workers who could only find part-time work
in December 2023. (Although in terms of sheer population, this *is* a
pretty small % of the workforce.)

``` r

#### Look at Time Series by Industry 2005-2024

The % of part-time workers who *can only find* part-time work fluctuates
with a similar trend across most industries. The Retail Industry appears
to sustain a higher level of workers who can only find part-time work.
The dashed reference line at 5% helps emphasize this.

``` r
data_summary6<-data6 %>% group_by(date,Industry) %>%
  summarize(involPT=sum(W_OFPTW), partTotal=sum(W_PTW)) %>%
  mutate(involPctofPT = round((involPT/partTotal)*100,2))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'date'. You can override using the `.groups`
    ## argument.

``` r
# Time Series

#### Look at mean values during full time period

Retail ranks high. This, along with the previous time series, shows
retail workers who can only find part-time work are **not** a new
phenomenon.

``` r
