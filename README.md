## Research Question
Should PT of FT labor be changed

## Decision Maker and Decision Being Made
We are currently undecided, but will likely be one of the following:
1. Policy maker: Should companies with a certain amount of employee hours be required have a certain percentage of those be FT?
2. CEO of a retail store such as Target: What is the financial advantages of PT vs FT?
