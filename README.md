# Group 1 (Christine GC Heinicke, Daniel Cusick, Haylee Allen, and Ran Tao) - Checkpoint 1 4/10/2024

## Discussion of progress on the eight major tasks. 
1. Propose a research topic:

Please see the file titled "Christine's Analysis.md" on information on our research topic and progress made on selecting a decision maker as well as articles and information that has inspired our analysis. 

2. Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration

For this checkpoint, we created separate documents for us each to display the analysis and work we have done. Our goal moving forward will be to expand on the analysis each of us has done and combine work as well as identify gaps and assign tasks to fill these gaps. 

3. Demonstrate merging of multiple data sources

Each of our analysis comes from different data sources. One thing we can do in the future is to create graphs and analysis created from merging data sets together. For now, much of the analysis has been completed as separate inspections of each dataset. 

4. Visualize data using Tableau, R, Python, or a combination

All analysis we have completed so far is in R for consistency and based on our comfortability with this software. As we develop our analysis, we are considering other visualization tools. 

5. Generate meaningful summary statistic (KPIs) of the data

While some KPIs have been identified in our individual analysis, there is room for improvement here as we merge our analysis to draw conclusions. 

6. Submit draft of progress at Chekpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2

Completing with this branch. While the visualizations created help us decide routes we may want to pursue, our graphs do need some cleaning up including improved titles and labels and appropriate scaling. 

7. Summmarize your findings in a short video presentation

Christine is working with the production team at the school for which she works to help develop our presentation. We are hoping to have everything submitted to them by the last week of April. 
   
8. Publish a detailed, well formatted markdown report of your analytical story to your GitHub reposity.

In progress - this will be the README file on our main branch.

## Comment on the challenges and victories of collaborating on GitHub.
The benefits of working with GitHub is our ability to work individually on our own schedules and to see the contributions of each team member. Additionally, we can each perform our own analysis and publish separately. Our main challenge has been our limited knowledge and exposure to GitHub. Currently, we are looking at how to merge RPubs with GitHub so our visuals can be seen here. If not, we can post a link to RPubs.

## Report the individual contributions of each team member. The latest working files should be pushed to the GitHub Repository.
Please see our individual md files for information on each of our contributions. Christine has continued to focus on our research goals and provided resources for analysis. Dan, Ran, and Haylee all used R to create summaries and visuals of various data. Our goal is combine these findings to create appropriate recommendations for our decision maker.
