For this analysis, I read in a subset of U.S. Census Current Population Survey data, which includes year, month, industry and employment status information. The data was extracted from [**IPUMS.org**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/). My goal is to gain insight on involuntary part-time work, particularly to tease out whether or not involuntary part-time work stands out in the retail industry.

```{r}
# Read in 2005-2024 census data
projpath<-"C:/Users/dancu/Documents/GitHub/Software-Tools-Spring-2024/Data_Tables"

### Selected variables from [**IPUMS Census Data Definitions**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/group?id=core_work)

* WHYPTLWK Reason for working part time last week
* WKSTAT Full or part-time status
* IND1950 Industry codes, which are [**comparable over time**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/IND1950#comparability_section)
* WTFINL sample weight for survey respondent

The WHYPTLWK census variable provides detailed reasons for part-time work. Here we have focused on **60 Could only find part-time work**. This is a subgroup of a classification often referred to as "Part-Time for Economic Reasons."
```{r}
ipums_val_labels(ddi, WHYPTLWK)%>% print(n=27)
```

The WKSTAT variable provides data on work status. Here we have focused on **12 Part-time for non-economic reasons, usually full-time** | **20 Part-time for economic reasons** | **21 Part-time for economic reasons, usually full-time** | **22 Part-time hours, usually part-time for economic reasons** | **40 Part-time for non-economic reasons, usually part-time** | **41 Part-time hours, usually part-time for non-economic reasons**
```{r}
ipums_val_labels(ddi, WKSTAT)
```

#### Data Prep: Consolidate Industries and date data
Group industries based on [**IND1950 Codes**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/IND1950#codes_section).
```{r}
data2 <- data %>%
  mutate(Industry = case_when(
    IND1950 >= 105 & IND1950 <= 126 ~ "Agriculture",
    IND1950 >= 206 & IND1950 <= 236 ~ "Mining",
    IND1950 == 246 ~ "Construction",
    IND1950 >= 306 & IND1950 <= 399 ~ "Manufacturing Durable Goods",
    IND1950 >= 406 & IND1950 <= 499 ~ "Manufacturing Nondurable Goods",
    IND1950 >= 506 & IND1950 <= 579 ~ "Transportation and Communication",
    IND1950 >= 586 & IND1950 <= 598 ~ "Utilities and Sanitary Services",
    IND1950 >= 606 & IND1950 <= 627 ~ "Wholesale Trade",
    IND1950 >= 636 & IND1950 <= 699 ~ "Retail Trade",
    IND1950 >= 716 & IND1950 <= 746 ~ "Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate",
    IND1950 >= 806 & IND1950 <= 817 ~ "Business and Repair Services",
    IND1950 == 826 ~ "Private Household Personal Services",
    IND1950 >= 836 & IND1950 <= 849 ~ "Personal services Other",
    IND1950 >= 856 & IND1950 <= 859 ~ "Entertainment and Recreation Services",
    IND1950 >= 868 & IND1950 <= 899 ~ "Professional and Related Services",
    IND1950 >= 906 & IND1950 <= 936 ~ "Public Administration",
    IND1950 >= 9997 & IND1950 <= 998 ~ "Other",
    TRUE ~ "Unknown"  # For values not covered in any range
  ))
```

Create a single Date field for time series
```{r}
data3<-data2 %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(YEAR,MONTH))
# check
data3[,c(1,3,14,15)]%>% filter(YEAR==2012,MONTH==12)
```

#### Survey Sample Weighting

* "For person-level analyses of non-supplement IPUMS-CPS data, apply the WTFINL variable. [**WTFINL gives the population represented by each individual in the sample.**](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/faq)"
* A WTFINL value of 2469 means the survey respondent is representative of 2469 Americans.
* The CPS survey is monthly. Therefore, each month should reflect a sample of the entire U.S. Population.
```{r}
# Look at WTFINL Weight
feb24<-data3 %>% filter(YEAR==2024, MONTH==2)
sum(feb24$WTFINL)
# 331,331,604 very close to U.S. Population
# For a given month, the weight values add up to the U.S. Population
```

To factor in the sample weights, we created 1-or-0 variables for “Could only find part-time work” (OFPTW) and “Part-Time Work” (PTW). This allows individuals who fit these categories to be easily multipled by their WTFINL weighted value.
```{r}
data4<-data3 %>% mutate(OFPTW = ifelse(WHYPTLWK==60,1,0),
                 PTW = ifelse(WKSTAT==12|WKSTAT==20|WKSTAT==21|WKSTAT==22|WKSTAT==40|WKSTAT==41,1,0))

data5<-data4[,c(1:3,8,11:17)] %>% filter(PTW==1)
data6<-data5 %>% mutate(W_OFPTW = WTFINL*OFPTW, W_PTW = WTFINL*PTW)
data6[,c(6:13)] %>% filter(Industry=="Retail Trade")
# Now the W_PTW column factors in the survey respondent's sample weight WTFINL
# WTFINL gives the population represented by each individual in the sample. 
# A WTFINL weight of 2469 means the survey respondent can be scaled up to represent 2469 Americans.
# W_OFPTW is 0 unless the person could only find part-time work
```

#### How many people are we talking about?
```{r}
# December 2023
data6 %>% filter(YEAR==2023,MONTH==12) %>% summarize(involPT=round(sum(W_OFPTW),0), partTotal=round(sum(W_PTW),0))
```

Retail tops the list of total workers who could only find part-time work in December 2023. (Although in terms of sheer population, this *is* a pretty small % of the workforce.)
```{r}
data6 %>% filter(YEAR==2023,MONTH==12)%>% group_by(Industry) %>% summarize(involPT=round(sum(W_OFPTW),0), partTotal=round(sum(W_PTW),0)) %>% arrange(desc(involPT)) %>% print(n=16)
```

#### Look at Time Series by Industry 2005-2024
The % of part-time workers who *can only find* part-time work fluctuates with a similar trend across most industries. The Retail Industry appears to sustain a higher level of workers who can only find part-time work. The dashed reference line at 5% helps emphasize this.
```{r}
data_summary6<-data6 %>% group_by(date,Industry) %>%
  summarize(involPT=sum(W_OFPTW), partTotal=sum(W_PTW)) %>%
  mutate(involPctofPT = round((involPT/partTotal)*100,2))

# Time Series
ggplot(data_summary6, aes(x=date, y=involPctofPT))+geom_line()+facet_wrap(~ str_wrap(Industry, width = 20)) +
  labs(title = "Could only Find Part-Time Work", subtitle="% of Part-Time Workers by Industry: 2005-2024",x="2005-2024 Time Period", y="% of Part-Time Workers")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5, linetype = "dashed", color = "red")
```


#### Zoom in on Retail
```{r}
data_summary6 %>% filter(Industry=="Retail Trade") %>%
ggplot(data=., aes(x=date, y=involPctofPT))+geom_line()+
  labs(title = "Could only Find Part-Time Work", subtitle="% of Part-Time Retail Workers: 2005-2024",x="Year", y="% of Part-Time Workers")
```

#### Look at mean values during full time period
Retail ranks high. This, along with the previous time series, shows retail workers who can only find part-time work are **not** a new phenomenon.
```{r}
# Bar Plots
data_summary6 %>% filter(Industry!="NA")%>% group_by(Industry) %>% 
  summarize(meanInvolPctofPT=mean(involPctofPT))%>%
  ggplot(data =., aes(x=reorder(Industry, -meanInvolPctofPT), y=meanInvolPctofPT, fill=Industry)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 7)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 25)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Retail Trade" = "red")) +
  ggtitle("Could only find part-time work", subtitle="% of Total Part-Time Workers by Industry: 2005 - Feb 2024")+
  labs(x = "Industry", y = "% of Part-Time Workers")+
  guides(fill = "none")
```

#### Look at 2023-2024 - still worth double-checking the most recent data.
Retail still ranks high.
```{r}
# Create data set of recent years 2023-2024
data_summary7<-data6 %>% filter(YEAR>2023) %>% group_by(date,Industry) %>%
  summarize(involPT=sum(W_OFPTW), partTotal=sum(W_PTW)) %>%
  mutate(involPctofPT = round((involPT/partTotal)*100,2))

data_summary7 %>% filter(Industry!="NA")%>% group_by(Industry) %>% 
  summarize(meanInvolPctofPT=mean(involPctofPT))%>%
  ggplot(data =., aes(x=reorder(Industry, -meanInvolPctofPT), y=meanInvolPctofPT, fill=Industry)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 7)) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 25)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Retail Trade" = "red")) +
  ggtitle("Could only find part-time work", subtitle="% of Total Part-Time Workers by Industry: 2023 - Feb 2024")+
  labs(x = "Industry", y = "% of Part-Time Workers")+
  guides(fill = "none")
```

#### Compare barplot of 2023-2024 data to recent jobs opening and quit rates

Read in Job Opening Rates and Quit Rates
Monthly Average by Industry (2023 and Jan 2024 preliminary results)
Industry classifications from this dataset are slightly different.
```{r}
jolts<-read.csv(file.path(projpath,"JOLTS.csv"))
head(jolts)
colnames(jolts)
names(jolts)[names(jolts) == "ï.."] <- "industry"
jolts<-data.table(jolts)

# melt month columns into rows
jolts2<- data.table::melt(data = jolts,
                          id.vars = c("industry", "Series.ID"),
                          measure.vars = c("Jan.2023",  "Feb.2023",  "Mar.2023",  "Apr.2023",  "May.2023",  "Jun.2023",  "Jul.2023", "Aug.2023",
                                           "Sep.2023",  "Oct.2023",  "Nov.2023",  "Dec.2023",  "Jan.2024"))

head(jolts2)
```


Retail has a relatively low Job Opening Rate
```{r}
jolts2 %>% filter(Series.ID=="Opening_Rate")%>% group_by(industry)%>% summarize(meanOpenings=mean(value))%>%
  ggplot(data =., aes(x=reorder(industry, -meanOpenings), y=meanOpenings, fill=industry)) + 
  geom_col() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 7))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("RETAIL TRADE" = "red")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 25)) +
  ggtitle("Job Opening Rate", subtitle = "2023 and Jan 2024")+
  labs(x = "Industry", y = "Opening Rate")+
  guides(fill = "none")
```

Retail has a relatively high Quit Rate
```{r}
jolts2 %>% filter(Series.ID=="Quit_Rate")%>% group_by(industry)%>% summarize(meanQuits=mean(value))%>%
  ggplot(data =., aes(x=reorder(industry, -meanQuits), y=meanQuits, fill=industry)) + 
  geom_col() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 7))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("RETAIL TRADE" = "red")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 25))+
  ggtitle("Job Quit Rate", subtitle = "2023 and Jan 2024")+
  labs(x = "Industry", y = "Quit Rate")+
  guides(fill = "none")
```


##### Over the past year, Retail has maintained a high pecentage of workers who are forced to work part-time because they could only find part-time work. Retail also has relatively low Job Openings and a higher Quit Rate. We can continue to analyze these dynamics.
