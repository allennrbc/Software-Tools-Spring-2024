## Research Question
"It’s Not Just Wages. Retailers Are Mistreating Workers in a More Insidious Way."
Feb. 19, 2024
By Adelle Waldman
Ms. Waldman’s forthcoming novel, “Help Wanted,” takes place in a big-box store.

Our inquiries have taken us to multiple first hand sources but our requests for information were fruitless

We have had to satisfy ourselves with aggregated sources that are excellent in their breadth and depth if not specific to our needs.

## We are currently looking at data to answer these questions:

1. Has the rate of part-time retail positions changed over time?
2. Is this “insidious” problem really new?
3. Can the ACA and FTE criteria relieve part of this "insidious" problem? What shortfalls remain to be addressed?

4. IF this is a new problem, what has changed in the retail workforce or in the general labor market
5. Has the business of retail changed?

6. Can we compare other jobs that were able to argue for consideration as full-time permanent employees?
    a. Contractors and Consultants granted Employee benefits
7.  What harms might such a change create? Considerations:

## Which graphs have already been created by FRED and by our group? 
## Which questions remain to be answered?

## What do preformatted FRED graphs already tell us?

### All Employees, Retail Trade (USTRADE)

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USTRADE

OBSERVATION - From 1939 to present, the gross numbers continue to grow with dips reflecting significant economic downturns. 
With so many jobs, representing so many hours, why are so many of these jobs part-time? What functions do these jobs represent that can't be completed by a full time employee?

### The largest changes in payroll employment

https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2020/05/the-largest-changes-in-payroll-employment/?utm_source=series_page&utm_medium=related_content&utm_term=related_resources&utm_campaign=fredblog

“...Both reductions in employment were orchestrated: In 1983, the labor stoppage was to achieve better working conditions [for telephone & telegraph workers]; in 2020, the labor stoppage [was] to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

OBSERVATION - Could we make a similar comparison between a recommendation to transition to more full time workers with another pre-existing data point (independent contractors for employees with benefits)?

One of the ACA FTE formulas allows/requires employers with multiple locations within a specific geographic area to make some part time jobs full time traveling positions.

### Average hourly earning of all employees, retail trade

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES4200000003

Can we confirm whether this hourly rate includes salaried and CEO pay or does it ONLY reflect hourly wage earners?

### 12-Month moving average of unweighted median hourly wage growth: Type of pay: paid hourly

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FRBATLWGT12MMUMHWGTPPH

Median of the year-over-year percent change in hourly wage rates computed at the individual level using linked wage records. Reported as a 12-month moving average. Paid Hourly denotes individuals who report that they are paid on an hourly basis.

### FTE Full-Time Equivalent employees as defined by the IRS for the ACA (Affordable Care Act) to determine ALE (Applicable Large Employers)

Could we improve the chances for successful adoption of our policy recommendations by adopting the definitions and formulas already in place, or adopting similar formulas/formulae?

Are we proposing a new solution or an incremental improvement to a preexisting solution? 

Would similar formulas/formulae simplify adoption by employers' HR departments?

Are there gaps between the available solutions provided by ACA and FTE, and the "insidious" problem?

## From the IRS website

https://www.irs.gov/affordable-care-act/employers/identifying-full-time-employees

A full-time employee for any calendar month is an employee who has on average at least 30 hours of service per week during the calendar month, or at least 130 hours of service during the calendar month.

A full-time equivalent employee is a combination of employees, each of whom individually is not a full-time employee, but who, in combination, are equivalent to a full-time employee. An employer determines its number of full-time-equivalent employees for a month in the two steps that follow:
1. Combine the number of hours of service of all non-full-time employees for the month but do not include more than 120 hours of service per employee, and
2. Divide the total by 120.

[CURRENTLY] An employer’s number of full-time equivalent employees (or part-time employees) is only relevant to determining whether an employer is an ALE.  An ALE need not offer minimum essential coverage to its part-time employees to avoid an employer shared responsibility payment.  A part-time employee’s receipt of the premium tax credit for purchasing coverage through the Marketplace cannot trigger an employer shared responsibility payment.

OBSERVATION Does our Policy Maker need to consider educating part-time employees about the premium tax credit for purchasing coverage through the Marketplace

#### The above formula could facilitate implementation of employer sponsored health care benefits to part-time workers.

## Decision Maker and Decision Being Made

## For the first month of data collection we left open who our decision maker might be so that we could better understand the available information and learn what it might tell us. We have learned that CEOs have been actively experimenting with higher wages and improved benefits to attract and retain personnel, but there remains a perversely high number of part-time positions that are not eligible for those improved benefits.

## We have come to the conclusion that a POLICY MAKER will need to lead this change.

## Retailers in the news

Two big US retailers have taken different approaches to the HBR succession planning arguments.

Workers say Target is making drastic cuts to their schedules and doubling their workload as it increases minimum wage under its ‘modernization plan’ to increase efficiency

### CEO
Retail represents 1 out of 4 US jobs. In a low unemployment market do CEOs need to consider sweetening the pot by offering more Full Time positions with benefits to attract and retain personnel, reduce turnover, increase institutional knowledge, and develop internal job growth? Note 1. effects of Seattle, WA increase in minimum wage and subsequent loss in jobs and 2. retail industry rate of tuition reimbursement programs (see Forbes

Any CEO in office now will have read one of the Harvard Business Review’s case studies on Succession Planning https://hbr.org/topic/subject/succession-planning 

They will be fully aware that the cost of hiring is greater than the cost to promote from within: See UMassGolabl.edu article "Three Ways businesses that promote from within can benefit" https://www.umassglobal.edu/news-and-events/blog/promoting-from-within

1. Promoting from within can save time and money
2. Internal mobility can help with retention and motivation
3. There’s less risk involved with internal promotions

Creating a pipeline for full time store personnel to join the executive training program should be cost effective. It could also generate a good public relations opportunity. 


### Policy Makers 
We would like to propose a policy that recognizes what most CEOs already know (as above)

AND

Consider the reality that US Health Insurance is provided by employers to 86%  of Americans according to the US Census Bureau. https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2024/02/health-care-costs.html#

Yet, there is a standard business practice that permits employers to not offer health benefits to part-time employees. 

### In particular, 
Are retailers exploiting part-time workers by denying them opportunities to work full time schedules with access to full benefits? 

1. Should employers be required to make some portion of their labor full time with benefits? 
2. What thresholds should be set? 
3. See FTE formula used for ACA calculation of ALE. 
4. Should employees working 130 hours per month, or 30 hours per week be eligible for health benefits?

## According to ADP 
https://www.adp.com/resources/articles-and-insights/articles/p/part-time-benefits.aspx 
"The ACA does not mandate coverage for part-time employees, but it does factor them into full-time equivalent (FTE) employee calculations. Depending on the number of part-time employees a business has and how many hours they work, it may meet the 50 FTE employee minimum and be required to provide health insurance for its full-time employees." 

The same report ADP answers the question "How many hours do you need to work to qualify for benefits?"

"Under the Affordable Care Act, employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees are required to provide health insurance only to those who work 30 hours per week or 130 hours per month. They can choose to extend benefits to employees who work less than that, but states and insurance companies may have minimum hourly requirements of their own." 

## According to Health Insurance.org
https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/full-time-equivalent/  
“The full-time equivalent is used to determine employer size under the ACA. Any employee working at least 30 hours per week is considered full time. In addition, part-time employees are counted using the full-time equivalent method of adding the total number of hours worked by all part time employees in a month, and dividing by 120.”

## From the FLSA website
(https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/full-time)
"The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer. Whether an employee is considered full-time or part-time does not change the application of the FLSA, nor does it affect application of the Service Contract Act or Davis-Bacon and Related Acts wage and fringe benefit requirements."

## From The Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division’s home page:  
https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/overtime/rulemaking
"On August 30, 2023, the Department of Labor announced issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), Defining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales, and Computer Employees." 

### And on January 10, 2024

## The U.S. Department of Labor published a final rule Employee or Independent Contractor Classification Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 
effective March 11, 2024. https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2024-00067/employee-or-independent-contractor-classification-under-the-fair-labor-standards-act

## Description of Data Set 

We have pulled data from the [**U.S. Census Current Population Survey (CPS)**](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.2023.html#list-tab-1979780401)
This is a monthly data set that includes data about people's employment status and industry
This is the census2324ind.csv file.

[**BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey**](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/data.htm)
This shows monthly Job Opening and Quit data across industries
This is the JOLTS.csv file.

Also consulted [**BLS Persons at work in nonagricultural industries by class of worker and usual full- or part-time status**](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat21.htm)

Lastly, we are examining data provided by the [**Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**](https://www.bea.gov/data)
The BEA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, provides economic accounts statistics that enable government and business decision-makers to follow and understand the performance of the U.S. economy.
