The purpose of this README document is to provide the research question being addressed and the data, tools, and methods used. 

## Research Question
Our research questions is currently in development, but we are considering the following items:

1. Has the rate of part-time retail positions changed over time?
2. Is this “insidious” problem really new?
3. Can we compare other industries that were able to argue for consultants and independent contractors to be converted to full-time employees with benefits?
4. What harms might such a change create?
   a. Consider the increase of minimum wage and possible reduction in the number of jobs and/or hours of work? (see UW Evans School of Public Policy & Governance December 3, 2021 report)

## Decision Maker and Decision Being Made
We are currently undecided, but will likely be one of the following:

### CEO
Retail represents 1 out of 4 US jobs. In a low unemployment market does our CEO need to consider sweetening the pot by offering more Full Time positions with benefits to attract and retain personnel, reducing turnover, increasing institutional knowledge, and developing internal job growth? Note increase in minimum wage and industry rate of tuition reimbursement programs.

Any CEO in office now will have read one of the Harvard Business Review’s case studies on Succession Planning ( https://hbr.org/topic/subject/succession-planning ). They will be fully aware that the cost of hiring is greater than the cost to promote from within: See UMassGolabl.edu article ( https://www.umassglobal.edu/news-and-events/blog/promoting-from-within ) "Three Ways businesses that promote from within can benefit":
1. Promoting from within can save time and money
2. Internal mobility can help with retention and motivation
3. There’s less risk involved with internal promotions
Creating a pipeline for full time store personnel to join the executive training program should be cost effective. It could also generate a good public relations opportunity. 


### Policy Makers 
Are retailers exploiting workers by denying them opportunities to work full time schedules with access to full benefits? Should employers be required to make some portion of their labor full time with benefits? What thresholds should be set? 

From the FLSA website 
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer. Whether an employee is considered full-time or part-time does not change the application of the FLSA, nor does it affect application of the Service Contract Act or Davis-Bacon and Related Acts wage and fringe benefit requirements.

Another consideration is the the implication of US Health Insurance being provided by employers to the vast majority of Americans and the reality that many part-time employees are ineligible for health benefits?

## Description of Data Set 

We have pulled data from the [**U.S. Census Current Population Survey (CPS)**](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.2023.html#list-tab-1979780401)
This is a monthly data set that includes data about people's employment status and industry
This is the census2324ind.csv file.

[**BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey**](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/data.htm)
This shows monthly Job Opening and Quit data across industries
This is the JOLTS.csv file.

Also consulted [**BLS Persons at work in nonagricultural industries by class of worker and usual full- or part-time status**](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat21.htm)

Lastly, we are examining data provided by consulted [**Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**](https://www.bea.gov/data)
The BEA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, provides economic accounts statistics that enable government and business decision-makers to follow and understand the performance of the U.S. economy.
